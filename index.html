          Civilisational history of Bangladesh previously known as East Bengal,
          dates back over four millennia, to the Chalcolithic. The country's
          early documented history featured successions of Hindu and Buddhist
          kingdoms and empires, vying for regional dominance. Islam arrived
          during the 6th-7th century AD and became dominant gradually since the
          early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji as well
          as activities of Sunni missionaries such as Shah Jalal in the region.
          Later, Muslim rulers initiated the preaching of Islam by building
          mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the Bengal
          Sultanate, founded by king Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, beginning a period
          of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the
          regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans as the richest
          country to trade with.[1] Afterwards, the region came under the Mughal
          Empire, as its wealthiest province. Bengal Subah generated almost half
          of the empire's GDP and 12% of the world's GDP,[2][3][4] larger than
          the entirety of western Europe, ushering in the period of
          proto-industrialization.[5] The population of the capital city, Dhaka,
          exceeded a million people. Following the decline of the Mughal Empire
          in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the
          Nawabs of Bengal, ultimately led by Siraj ud-Daulah. It was later
          conquered by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey
          in 1757. Bengal directly contributed to the Industrial Revolution in
          Britain but led to its deindustrialization.[6][7][8][9] The Bengal
          Presidency was later established. The borders of modern Bangladesh
          were established with the separation of Bengal and India in August
          1947, when the region became East Pakistan as a part of the newly
          formed State of Pakistan following the end of British rule in the
          region.[10] Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence in March 1971 led
          to the nine-month long Bangladesh Liberation War, that culminated with
          East Pakistan emerging as the People's Republic of Bangladesh. After
          independence, the new state endured famine, natural disasters, and
          widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and military coups.

            <p class="para-one">
              The Greater Mymensingh region (Mymensingh District along with five
              other neighbouring districts) was created as a Mymensingh district
              by the British Indian government in 1787. Later it was reorganized
              in two phases into six districts: Mymensingh, Kishoreganj,
              Netrakona, Jamalpur, Tangail, and Sherpur.[3] But Kishoreganj and
              Tangail are no longer part of Mymensingh, so Mymensingh comprises
              four districts. On 12 January 2015 prime minister Sheikh Hasina
              declared the establishment of a new Mymensingh Division. The
              initial intention was to carve six districts (those comprising the
              original Mymensingh district of 1787) out of the Dhaka Division.
              However, while four of the districts were eager for the
              establishment of a new division, people in the Tangail and
              Kishoreganj Districts wished to remain part of Dhaka
              Division.[4][5] On 14 September 2015 Mymensingh was officially
              announced as a division consisting four districts.[6][7][8]

              Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh and also the largest city
              as well of the country. It comes among the 10 most populous cities
              of the world. The Division as constituted prior to 2015 covered an
              area of 31,051 km2,[2] and had a population of 47,424,418 at the
              2011 Census. However, following the separation of the new
              Mymensingh Division in 2015,the area has been reduced to 20,508.8
              km2 with a population at the 2021 Census of 21,741,005. Dhaka
              Division borders every other division in the country except
              Rangpur Division. It is bounded by Mymensingh Division to the

            <h1>COX'BAZAR DIVISION</h1>
            <p class="para-one">
              The history of Cox's Bazar begins in the Mughal period. On his way
              to Arakan, when the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja (1616–1660) passed
              through the hilly terrain of the present day Cox's Bazar, he was
              class="para-one" attracted to the scenic nature of the region. He
              commanded his forces to camp there. A place named Dulahazara,
              meaning "one thousand palanquins", still exists in the area. After
              the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and
              the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.
              Cox's Bazar is named after Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the
              East India Company, who was assigned with the charges of the
              current day Cox's Bazar and its adjacent areas.[3][4] The town of
              Cox's Bazar was established in 1799 as a market town to honour
              Captain Cox. In 1854, Cox's Bazar was made a Sub Divisional
              headquarter in Chittagong district under the Bengal Presidency of
              British India. After the end of British rule in 1947, Cox's Bazar
              remained a part of East Pakistan under the Dominion of Pakistan
              till 1971. Captain Advocate Fazlul Karim was the first chairman
              after independence from the British of Cox's Bazar municipality.
              He established the Tamarisk Forest along the beach to draw tourism
              to the town and to protect the beach from the tide. He donated
              many of his father-in-law's and his own lands to establish a
              public library and town hall. In 1971, the wharf was used as a
              naval port by the Pakistan Navy's gunboats. This and the nearby
              airstrip of the Pakistan Air Force were the scene of intense
              shelling by the Indian Navy during the Bangladesh Liberation War
              in 1971.
